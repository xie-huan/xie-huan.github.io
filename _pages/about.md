I received the B.S. degree in software engineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2020. I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with Chongqing University under the supervision of Prof. Yan Lei. His research interests include fault localization for software and deep learning programs, as well as automated program repair.

## Research Interests

- Quality Assurance for Software Testing
- Software Testing for Traditional and Deep Learning Programs
